# Case study: Part 2 (60 minutes)

# Steps in completing our solution
#  Merging data frames
#  Working with lists and results of statistics
#  Reiteration

# ---- Exercise 1 ----
# Create a function that will calculate the ANOVA for all the genes in a file,
# Which is where we ended the last script. 
# Call it process_qPCR()

# Use this generic form for your function
myFun <- function(x) {
  y <- x*100
  return(y)
}

myFun(4)


# ---- Exercise 2 ----
# Check to see that your function works:


# ---- Exercise 3 ----
# Get list of all files in the "data/" directory, including their full names
# Assign this to the object myFiles


# ---- Exercise 4 ----
# "map" each element myFiules onto the process_qPCR function you calculated above.
